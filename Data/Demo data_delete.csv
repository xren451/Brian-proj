4558,At 10:30 p.m. on January 9  2013  Employee #1  a crane operator employed by  Concrete General Inc.  along with Coworker #1  a rigger  and Coworker #2  a  laborer  were using a mobile crane as part of a bridge repair project. The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was  transported to a hospital  where he received treatment for a knee  bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.

4564,Employees #1 and #2 were being hoisted up a 500 ft telecommunications tower to  replace antenna parts damaged when the tower was struck by lightning. They  were being raised by a 1/2 in. nylon rope load line using a friction winch.  Employee #2 was attached to the load line by a pelican clip that was attached  to a seat strap D-ring by a small clevis on his tree saddle safety belt. The  pelican clip had been run through a hand-tied loop in the end of the rope load  line. Employee #1 was attached to the same loop by the center clip of a short  three-clip rope safety lanyard  as were the replacement antenna parts. The  remaining clips were attached to the waist D-rings on her full body harness.  The rope load line had been routed up the tower through a 3 in. McKissik top  block pulley that had been hand-tied to the face of the tower by two pieces of  1/2 in. climbing rope  at a height of approximately 475 ft. The 1/2 in. nylon  load line was then routed back down the tower and through a heel block pulley  attached near the base. The free end was then wrapped around a cathead  (capstan hoist) which had been bolted to the left rear wheel of a small  pick-up truck  with the wheel jacked up off the ground. With the pickup truck  idling  Employee #3 manually pulled on the free end of the rope  hoisting  Employees #1 and #2 up the tower. The two employees were at a height of  approximately 385 ft when the pickup's engine apparently stalled. When a  coworker tried to restart the engine  friction was lost between the rope load  line and the capstan hoist drum  causing Employees #1 and #2 to fall. They  struck a guy at a height of about 210 ft and managed to ride it to the ground.  Employee #1 was killed.

4572,At approximately 7:30 a.m. on September 17  2013  Employee #1 and Coworker #1   employed by a plumbing contractor  were working at an aerospace manufacturing  plant. Employee #1  a plumber's assistant  was assembling a pipe section to a  ball valve. He was using a pipe and bolt threading machine  Ridge Tool Company  Model 1822-I. This machine is operated by a foot- switch pedal. The  foot-switch pedal is like the gas pedal of a car: when you step on it  the  machine starts rotating; when you step off it  the machine stops rotating.  Employee #1 was using the machine to grip the pipe in a fixed position. He was  using his right hand to thread the valve onto the stationary section of the  pipe. Employee #1 had his right hand on the pipe and under the ball valve. He  unintentionally activated the machine via the foot-switch pedal. The machine  started to rotate  and the pipe rotated toward Employee #1. His fingers were  trapped between the valve handle and the valve body. Employee #1 immediately  either released the foot-switch pedal or kicked it away. Coworker #1  who was  approximately 5 feet away  came and turned off the machine using the  on/off-type switch on the side of the machine. However  the machine had  already rotated enough to break Employee #1 right index finger by bending it  backwards. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to  the hospital  where he underwent surgery to repair the fractured right index  finger. The subsequent investigation of this event determined that the injury  was caused by the machine unintentionally being activated by Employee #1 via  the foot pedal while his hand was on the pipe being gripped by the pipe and  bolt threading machine.

4584,At about 3:00 p.m. on July 9  2013   Employee #1  a foreman with Razmik  Tarkhanian Dba Bridge Iron  was securing a 22 ft wide by 65 ft long trellis  between two buildings that were under construction. Employee #1 was working  alone  removing safety brackets  with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene)  from  the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above  the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to  the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible  for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently  the  structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman   when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail  under the load  and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported  to the hospital  and he was admitted for over 24 hours  for chest and facial  fractures.,General construction,Crush,Mechanical,Non-fatal,Trellis,Structural failure,Acetylene torch,Cutting operation,N/A,N/A,Trellis collapsed during cutting operation,Employee/Fractures/Hospitalization,Trapped by falling trellis,"Proper structural assessment, safe work practices"

Dba Bakersfield Well & Pump Company  began  cutting a pipe with an oxygen-acetylene torch after he removed the cap from  the well casing and marked the cut line. He was cutting the well casing to  raise it for the pump pad. Then  a piece of slag fell in excess of 30 ft down  into the well casing  igniting an unknown substance. This caused flames to  rise to the top of the well. Employee #1 was leaning over the open well casing  when flames hit him in the arms  neck and chest area. Employee #1 received  flash burns to the face  neck  anterior torso and bilateral upper extremities.  The well was not properly tested with a gas monitor prior to cutting the well  casing.

4586,On January 3  2011  the owner of a contracting company and Employee #1 were  removing the roof of a building as part of a demolition project. When they  removed the main support beam of the roof  the northern section of roof  collapsed. One truss of the southern roof portion remained attached to the  main support beam and was bent approximately 6 feet of the truss down toward  the ground. The owner then decided they should stop for the day and left the  immediate area to park the bobcat skid loader in another portion of the  building; however  Employee #1 continued to work while the owner was out of  the area. The owner walked back to the area where the work was being  conducted  and he heard an oxygen acetylene torch running. He felt the  building vibrate and heard a large crash. The owner arrived in the area and  found Employee #1 under a pile of concrete and mortar. The debris came from a  portion of the wall in the work area.

He was pulling on a painting spray hose so it  would reach the work area when he struck the power line and was electrocuted.  A coworker rushed to help him and Emergency Services was called. The Fire  Department responded and transported Employee #1 to the hospital  where he was  pronounced dead. He had been using proper fall protection equipment and had  received basic safety training  but nothing related to the hazards associated  with overhead power lines. His employer had been in the trade for more than 10  years and should have been knowledgeable about the safety requirements for  working around power lines  but it had not scheduled any special provisions  for this job site.

4594,On November 12  2013  Employee #1  with Three Frogs Inc.  was cutting down a  eucalyptus tree. Employee #1 was operating an aerial lift from inside the  bucket  and a coworker was also in the bucket of the aerial lift  using a  chain saw to cut branches. After initially cutting five (eight ft) sections  near the top of the tree  Employee #1 raised the lift and attached a rope line  halfway up the branch. Three other coworkers were below on the ground and were  holding onto the line  in an effort to control the fall of the branch.  Employee #1 positioned the lift near the lowest crotch  while the coworker  using the chain saw made several cuts at the base of the approximately 30 ft  branch. Instead of falling away from the aerial lift bucket and toward the  three employees who were pulling on the rope  the branch fell towards Employee  #1 and the coworker  who were in the aerial lift bucket. The coworker in the  bucket was able to move out of the way of the falling branch  which then  struck Employee #1 in the back of the head  striking his forehead against the  top rail of the aerial lift bucket. Employee #1 sustained blunt force trauma  head injuries.

4595,At approximately 11:20 a.m. on November 7  2013  Employee #1 was operating an  aerial lift and assisting a crew with the demolition of a 135 ft tall  building. The crew consisted of a supervisor  the owner of the company  and  two other employees that were working together to demo the building. The group  had cut the top of four out of the five southwestern most main support beams  earlier that day with no issues. They moved to the northwestern beams and  began cutting the top of four out of five beams  but could not get the I-beam  piece out. After breaking a new 0.625 in. diameter choker  they tried to  extract the piece out  but could not. It was then decided by the owner   supervisor and Employee #1 to cut the bottom of the beam to get the roof to  collapse. Employee #1 made the pre-cuts (cutting the beam  but not cutting all  the way through the beam)  and then he went to the ground in the aerial lift  to get a choker and shackles to attach the lower piece of the beam to the arm  of the Hi-Lo machine that was located on the south end of the building. Once  elevated back to the beam that was pre-cut  Employee #1 attached the shackles  and choker to the arm of the Hi-Lo machine and the cut beam. Employee #1 made  the final cuts to the beam. Employee #1 started down in the aerial lift that  was located on the north end of the building. Instead of booming to the left  (away from the building) and then down  Employee #1 came straight down the  west side of the building. Every other time  Employee #1 had boomed away from  the building and then down according to the owner. As Employee #1 reached  approximately 80 ft above the ground  the roof above the I-beam collapsed. The  piece of the beam that was attached to the Hi-Lo arm swung out and hit  Employee #1 in the back of the neck area  pushing him against the controls of  the aerial lift. The owner of the company went to the lower controls of the  aerial lift and lowered the basket to the ground. By the time the basket was  on the ground  the plant nurses and first responders were on site and started  medical attention on Employee #1. Emergency medical personnel transported  Employee #1 to a county hospital.

They were painting the building's eaves while working from a  lift  a scissor-style self-propelled aerial work platform  at an elevation of  15 feet. They needed to relocate the lift. While doing so  they drove over an  open storm drain grate  the location of which was obstructed by the plastic.  The rear tire of the lift fell into the opening  which caused the lift to tip  over. Employee #1 jumped from the lift as it was falling. He struck the ground  on the asphalt.

4598,"At approximately 8:15 a.m. on July 18  2013  Employee #1  an electrician  employed by an electrical and other wiring installation company  was working  as a subcontractor installing electrical wires in the Stage Area of a building  site. He was operating a scissor lift  a Skyjack SJ111-3219  Equipment No.  103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical  wires. After positioning the lift  he raised the lift's platform to reach the  conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left  conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit  he needed to  move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the  other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he  reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand  to move the  lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to  the right. However  the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the  toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately  released the controller and tried to move the platform down  but it continued  to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and  an overhead pipe. Eventually  Employee #1 was able to bring the platform down.  Emergency services were called  and the San Mateo Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three  days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Mateo Fire Department and  the Employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  respectively  on July  18  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation at the work site at  approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 30  2013. Participating in the inspection  were Employee #1's foreman/supervisor  the project superintendent of the  general contractor  and the field operations manager of the general  contractor. The investigation revealed that Employee #1's employer had leased  the scissor lift from Sunstate Equipment since October 16  2012. The employer  returned the scissor lift to Sunstate Equipment on July 19  2013  the day  after Employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's  possession  the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering  problem  and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability  to go up. Cal/OSHA did not issue an Accident-Related citation  because the  investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of Title 8   California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR). However  Cal/OSHA issued one General  Citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the  proper use of Skyjack III 3219 Scissor Lift  in accordance with the  manufacturer's operating instructions  and Section 3203  Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  Section 3638(d).",Electrical,Other,Mechanical,Non-fatal,Scissor lift,Control confusion,Switch,Improper setting,Pipe,Proximity,Face caught between lift guardrail and pipe due to control mishandling,Employee/Multiple facial fractures/Hospitalization,Face caught between lift guardrail and overhead pipe,"Safe operation of scissor lifts, equipment training"

4616,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on April 27  2007  Employee #1 was working from an  aerial lift  JLG Model Number 400S  Serial Number 30079117  approximately 21  feet above ground  welding steel bracing under the ceiling of a commercial  building under construction. A coworker noticed that Employee #1 seemed to be  not moving and blue in the face. Employee #1 was lowered to the ground and  cardio-pulmonary resuscitation started but was unsuccessful. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the scene  apparently due to being caught between the  aerial lift and a brace. The aerial lift was later tested and problems were  identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the  boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom  when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the  control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on  the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering.  There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and  spring. Once the granular material was removed  the control stick functioned  properly and self centered.,General construction,Crush,Mechanical,Fatal,Aerial boom manlift,Control malfunction,Steel brace,Solid structure,N/A,N/A,"Control stick failure, pinned against brace",Death by asphyxiation,Caught between aerial lift and brace,"Regular equipment inspection, safe operation of lifts"

4632,On September 29  2009  Employees #1 and #2  who were employed by a restoration  services company  were working in an apartment unit  on the second floor of an  inhabited  four-story multi-unit residential building. The workers had been at  the site on two previous occasions to expose framing members by removing  drywall and then to enclosed the subject area with plastic sheeting. Because  test results from an independent testing lab showed that mold was still  present  Employees #1 and #2 returned to the apartment unit a third time to  encapsulate the mold. Employees #1 and #2 were spraying Kilz(R) Original  Aerosol to encapsulate visible mold that was on the framing members of an  interior partition wall of the apartment unit  while inside the  plastic-enclosed containment area. The homeowner was in the kitchen area of  the apartment. Employees #1 and #2 exhausted four and one-half  13-ounce-sized  cans of the flammable aerosol within the containment area  which measured 41  inches deep by 8 feet long by 8 feet  10 inches high. They then plugged into  an electrical outlet an OmniAire 1000V HEPA air filtration machine  which was  also inside the containment area. An explosion and fire occurred  when an  ignition source was introduced inside the containment area where flammable  vapors were concentrated. Employees #1 and #2 sustained serious burns (second  and third degree) to their upper bodies and faces. They required inpatient  hospitalization for more than 24 hours. According to the manufacturer   OmniAire 1000V was an air filtering machine designed for filtering  particulates and providing negative air pressure for asbestos abatement. The  machine was listed as meeting requirements for UL (Underwriters Laboratories)  Standard UL507 for Safety for Electric Fans. The listing did not include use  in hazardous atmospheres  where flammable vapors were present. The machine had  a variable speed controller and Emerson  open-frame type fan motor. The  investigation found that the employer's IIPP (Injury and Illness Prevention  Program) lacked several required elements and that the workers were not  trained on the physical or health hazards of the Kilz(R) Original Aerosol.  Further  the improper use of listed equipment in a hazardous atmosphere caused  the explosion and fire.
